      content: "The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth.
                          For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in
                          their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new
                          common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.
                          To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more
                          common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more
                          simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more
                          simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental;
                          in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English,
                          as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages
                          are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music,
                          sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar,
